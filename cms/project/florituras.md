SOPHIE AGUILERA X MARÍA OROVIO

A 'floritura', according to the RAE, is an especially showy or complicated adornment. A term that refers to an aesthetic excess that fills with unnecessary ornaments any object, composition or action that comes our way. It is well known that a flourish does not ask for permission, it exists in and of itself, abundant and joyful, conscious and satisfied of its uselessness.

The exhibition FLORITURAS by Sophie Aguilera gathers a group of ceramic works that proudly embrace ornament and excess. With the help of the muralist María Orovio, the artists propose a space where color, artifice and theatricality coexist in harmony with everyday objects inspired by tradition and customs. The result of this exhibition is a sculptural approach to the pictorial genre of the still life where vases of flowers, precious stacked fabrics, fruits and shells appeal to nostalgia and humor, to chance and the mundane.

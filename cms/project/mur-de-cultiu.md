Connecthort is a space of confluence between Poblenou neighbors, organizations and citizens, where different activities related to the environmental, educational, cultural, artistic, sporting and productive fields can be educational, cultural, artistic, sporting and productive activities. ConnectHORT is developed around a central axis, the permacultural garden (following the basic principles of the ecosystems), and is proposed as a as a place of connection between people and their environment, working along the lines of sustainability.

Together with the Bioma community, we worked around permaculture and seasonal crops to design, through play, a participatory mural to design, through play, a proposal for a participatory mural for the perimeter wall of the urban garden. for the perimeter wall of the urban garden. We propose a form of urban transformation that uses painting, play and collaborative design as methods for collaborative design as methods of territorial dynamization and citizen bonding, in order to generate a learning meeting on a specific topic and develop a community project.

From the support of +Model in the context of the Festival Model de Arquitectures de Barcelona, we met with members of the Poblenou community to talk about the various crops that grow in the the various crops that grow in the Bioma space, as well as discussing new ways of making architecture through urban art. Taking these two themes, we introduced the project 'Mur de Cultiu' and invited all the participants to distribute the crops to all the participants to distribute the crops along the grid that represents te perimeter wall of Connecthort.

Project carried out together with Tiffany Whittaker, territorial designer and cultural manager based in Barcelona.

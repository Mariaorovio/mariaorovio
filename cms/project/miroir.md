A backdrop called ‘Miroir’,

A mirror that tells the stories that are reflected in it.

‍

The Vaisseau3008, located in the city of Nîmes, France, is what is known as a ‘Tiers lieu’: a place created by the citizens to overcome isolation and energise the territory. A place to work together and rebuild links, to contribute to economic development and to the activation of local resources. The Miroir mural was created on one of the many façades of the building, a mural that would serve as a backdrop for the cultural activities that would later take place in front of it: concerts, workshops, shows... It was created with the help of residents of the Vaisseau3008, young refugees, pupils from the Bouillargues school and volunteers who wanted to join the project. 190m2 of colour and geometry that today coexist with the people who work or spend their daily lives in this building.

Photographs by María Jou Sol and María Orovio.
